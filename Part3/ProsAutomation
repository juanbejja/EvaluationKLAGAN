#Pros of test automation:

#Increased time and cost effectiveness 

Automated testing requires less execution time than manual testing. 
Although they have a higher initial cost, this cost is amortized over time with respect to the gains it brings.

#Facilitates the implementation of continuous integration

Implementing this methodology without automated testing would be impossible, since developers would have to run manual tests every time they make changes. 
run manual tests every time they make changes to the main source. 
Automated tests can be run every time changes are made automatically.

#Ensures quality in software development

Software testing must be repeated several times during the development cycle to ensure quality. 
Each time the source code is modified, software testing should be repeated, taking into consideration all operating systems and hardware configurations 
where it operates.
and hardware configurations where it operates.


In this project we used Cucumber technology under the POM pattern because it facilitates the approach to perform plain text functional descriptions 
(usually this technology is used under BDD approach where the tests are performed together with the Product Owners). 
The datasource of the tests are in the classes of each screen.
An alternative for larger projects would be to have the datasource in JSON files or in a database.
